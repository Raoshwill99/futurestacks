# FutureStack: Pioneering Real-World Blockchain Solutions with STX

## Project Overview

FutureStack is an innovative project aimed at leveraging the power of Stacks (STX) blockchain technology to address pressing global challenges. By creating a sustainable ecosystem where real-world problems meet blockchain solutions.

## Features

- Propose and track blockchain-based solutions to global issues
- Community engagement through transparent solution management
- Integration with Stacks blockchain for secure and decentralized operations
- Voting system for community-driven solution prioritization
- Funding mechanism for direct financial support of solutions
- Role-based access control for enhanced governance

## Technical Stack

- Blockchain: Stacks (STX)
- Smart Contract Language: Clarity
- Backend: To be determined
- Frontend: To be determined

## Smart Contract Structure

The core of FutureStack is a Clarity smart contract that manages the lifecycle of proposed solutions. Key components include:

1. Solution Management:
   - Add new solutions
   - Retrieve solution details
   - Update solution status (admin only)

2. Community Engagement:
   - Vote for solutions
   - Donate STX to support solutions

3. Governance:
   - User role management (admin/member)
   - Role-based access control for sensitive operations

4. Data Structures:
   - Solutions map: Stores all proposed solutions with extended attributes
   - User roles map: Manages user roles for governance
   - Solution counter: Ensures unique IDs for each solution

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Stacks blockchain environment set up
- Clarity CLI tools installed

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/futurestack.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd futurestack
   ```

3. Deploy the smart contract (specific commands to be added as the project develops)

## Usage

### Proposing a Solution
```clarity
(contract-call? .futurestack add-solution "Solution Name" "Description" "Impact Area")
```

### Voting for a Solution
```clarity
(contract-call? .futurestack vote-for-solution solution-id)
```

### Donating to a Solution
```clarity
(contract-call? .futurestack donate-to-solution solution-id amount)
```

### Setting User Roles (Admin Only)
```clarity
(contract-call? .futurestack set-user-role user-principal "admin")
```

(Note: More detailed usage instructions to be added as the project develops)
